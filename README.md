# EDA on Google PlayStore Apps

## Overview
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Google PlayStore Apps. The goal is to gain insights and understand the patterns, trends, and characteristics of the apps available on the Google PlayStore.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from the Google PlayStore. It contains various attributes of different apps, such as app category, rating, reviews, size, price, and more. The dataset provides a rich collection of information that can be used to analyze app trends and user preferences.

## Objectives
The main objectives of this EDA project are as follows:

1. Data Cleaning: Perform data cleaning tasks, including handling missing values, removing duplicates, and resolving inconsistencies.

2. Data Exploration: Explore the dataset to gain insights into the following aspects:
   - App categories and their distribution
   - Ratings and reviews distribution
   - App size and its impact on popularity
   - Price range and its correlation with ratings and reviews

3. Trends and Patterns: Identify the most popular app categories, analyze the impact of app size and price on user ratings and reviews, and discover any notable trends or patterns.

4. Visualization: Create visualizations such as bar plots, scatter plots, and histograms to effectively communicate the findings of the analysis.

## Tools and Libraries
The project will be implemented using the following tools and libraries:

- Python: The programming language used for data analysis and processing.
- Jupyter Notebook: The development environment for running Python code and creating interactive data visualizations.
- Pandas: A powerful library for data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn: Libraries for creating visualizations.
- NumPy: A library for numerical computing.
- scipy: for pearson correlations coefficient

## Workflow
The project will follow the following workflow:

1. Data Loading: Load the dataset into a pandas dataframe for analysis.

2. Data Cleaning: Perform data cleaning tasks, including handling missing values, removing duplicates, and resolving inconsistencies.

3. Data Exploration: Explore the dataset using descriptive statistics, visualizations, and data aggregation techniques.

4. Analysis and Insights: Analyze the data to identify trends, patterns, and correlations between different attributes.

5. Visualization: Create visualizations to present the findings and insights in a clear and visually appealing manner.

6. Conclusion: Summarize the key findings and insights from the analysis.

## Usage
To replicate the analysis, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your terminal.

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook file `Google_PlayStore_EDA.ipynb` to access and run the code.

4. Follow the instructions and comments in the notebook to perform the EDA and visualize the results.

## Conclusion
This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of Google PlayStore Apps using EDA techniques. By exploring the dataset and visualizing the insights, we can gain a better understanding of the app landscape, user preferences, and the factors that contribute to app popularity and success.

Feel free to contribute, provide feedback, and use the findings and code as a reference for your own analysis. Happy exploring!
